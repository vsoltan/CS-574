# this module should include
# - a MLP that processes each point i into a 128-dimensional vector f_i
# - another MLP that further processes these 128-dimensional vectors into h_i (same number of dimensions)
# - a max-pooling layer that collapses all point features h_i into a global shape representaton g
# - a concat operation that concatenates (f_i, g) to create a new per-point descriptor that stores local+global information
# - a MLP that transforms this concatenated descriptor into the output 32-dimensional descriptor x_i

# CorrNet module that serves 2 purposes:  
# (a) uses the PointNet module to extract the per-point descriptors of the point cloud (out_pts)
#     and the same PointNet module to extract the per-vertex descriptors of the mesh (out_vtx)
# (b) if self.train_corrmask=1, it outputs a correspondence mask
# The CorrNet module should
# - include a (shared) PointNet to extract the per-point and per-vertex descriptors 
# - normalize these descriptors to have length one
# - when train_corrmask=1, it should include a MLP that outputs a confidence 
#   that represents whether the mesh vertex i has a correspondence or not
#   Specifically, you should use the cosine similarity to compute a similarity matrix NxM where
#   N is the number of mesh vertices, M is the number of points in the point cloud
#   Each entry encodes the similarity of vertex i with point j
#   Use the similarity matrix to find for each mesh vertex i, its most similar point n[i] in the point cloud 
#   Form a descriptor matrix X = NxF whose each row stores the point descriptor of n[i] (from the point cloud descriptors)
#   Form a vector S = Nx1 whose each entry stores the similarity of the pair (i, n[i])
#   From the PointNet, you also have the descriptor matrix Y = NxF storing the per-vertex descriptors
#   Concatenate [X Y S] into a N x (2F + 1) matrix
#   Transform this matrix into the correspondence mask Nx1 through a MLP followed by a linear transformation
